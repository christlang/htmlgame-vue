This game is a demo project for programming with <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>; it will be discussed extensively in a tutorial in <a href="http://www.heise.de/ct/">c't Magazin</a> issue ca. 16/18. This game has already been implemented with React (<a href="https://woerter.de/projects/htmlgame/">demo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/wortwart/htmlgame/">code</a>) which makes both libraries comparable. However, the Vue.js version has some improvements and extra features.

The data come from the W3C recommendation <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-html51-20171003/">HTML 5.1-2</a> (October 2017); additional elements from <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">WHATWG HTML</a> (state: May 2018) were marked as experimental.

## Installation

After cloning, simply run

    npm i

to install Vue.js, the single project dependency. The code is frontend only and requires a webserver.
